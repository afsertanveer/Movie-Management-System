# Movie-Management-System
New films are produced non-stop and it is quite easy to watch them via online video streaming services nowadays. As binge watching has become popular, you might easily lose track of all these different movies and series episodes already seen. A streaming service might help to remember, which films were already watched by one person, and can also suggest new films based on this personâ€™s taste, but if multiple persons share one account or if you use multiple streaming services or watch traditional linear TV or go to cinema or watch films using physical media like  DVD or VHS, things get more difficult. This system has been developed to keep an overview about already watched films and should also be able to suggest new films based on the personal taste.
